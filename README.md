# MySQL-CLI-Online-Store

## Functionality
Customer Functionality

This Node.js & MySQL app emulates the basic functionality of an online ecommerce store.
Customers are presented with a list of purchaseable products available for sale.
Transactions are processed including total purchase price while stock inventories are updated accordingly in MySQL. If the customer wants more product than inventory allows, the app alerts them of insufficient stock levels.

2. Show Low Inventory -- Allows manager to see products that are currently sitting at a stock level of less than 5.
3. Add New Inventory -- Allows manager to add quantities to specific item ids for replenishment.
4. Add New Products -- Allows manager to update the inventory with new product information (including price, department, and current stock levels)

Supervisor Functionality
1. Show product sales/overhead costs for all departments
2. Create new Departments
3. FUTURE UPDATE -- Add profit column for calculating sales vs costs.
